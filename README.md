Welcome to **Iverilog**!  
This repository contains Verilog source code and projects. It is intended for learning, experimenting, and demonstrating digital design concepts using Verilog HDL.

## Features

- Example Verilog modules for a variety of digital circuits
- Organized source files for easy navigation
- Ready to use for simulation and synthesis
- Open for contributions and improvements

## Getting Started
